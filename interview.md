# GENERAL QUESTIONS

## What is deep learning?
Deep learning is a subarea of machine learning and AI. It involves training large models based on artificial neural networks on data.

The models learn to solve challenging predictive and inference tasks (such as classification, regression, object recognition in images, etc.) by automatically discovering complex patterns and features underlying the data.

## When should you choose deep learning over machine learning solutions?
Deep learning solutions stand out in problems where the data has high complexity, e.g. under unstructured or high-dimensional data.

It is also the preferred choice for problems with massive amounts of data or requiring capturing nuanced patterns

## How would you choose the right deep learning approach for your problem and data?
Perform a thorough analysis of your data features. 
Based on the data analysis, select the most suitable type of deep learning architecture.
For example, CNNs excel in processing visual data, whereas RNNs are particularly effective on sequential data
Consider model interpretability, scalability, and the availability of labeled data for training.

## How would you architect a deep learning solution for classification?

choose the appropriate number and size of layers of neurons, as well as choosing the right activation functions.
These decisions are typically made predicated on the characteristics of the data. 

## Challenges and solutions in deep learning models.
overfitting, vanishing and exploding gradients, and the necessity of large amounts of labeled data for training.

Overfitting occurs when a model learns in a way that it “excessively memorizes” how the training data appears, so it later struggles to perform correct inferences on any future, unseen data. To address it, there are techniques focused on reducing model complexity, like regularization or limiting how much the model learns from the data, e.g. through early stopping.
Vanishing and exploding gradients are related to convergence issues towards non-optimal solutions during the weight-updating process that underlies the training process. Gradient clipping and advanced activation functions can help mitigate this problem.
If the challenge lies in limited labeled data, try exploring transfer learning and data augmentation techniques to harness pre-trained models or generate synthetic data, respectively.

# ENGINEERING QUESTIONS

## How would you use TensorFlow to build a simple feedforward neural network for image classification?
This includes specifying the appropriate number of neurons and activation functions per layer and defining the final layer (output layer) with softmax activation.
Then, we would compile the model specifying a suitable loss function like categorical cross-entropy, an optimizer like Adam, and validation metrics before training it on the training data during a specified number of epochs. Once the model has been built, its performance on the validation set can be evaluated.

## Handling overfitting via regularization techniques
Incorporate regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization with penalty terms added to the loss function.
Alternatively, dropout layers can be introduced to randomly disable neurons during training; this prevents the model from overly relying on specific features extracted from the data.
These two strategies can be combined with early stopping to finalize training when validation performance starts degrading.

## Example of using transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained deep learning model for a new task
Pre-trained models can be loaded for transfer learning and fine-tuning purposes.
Replace the model head, i.e. the final classification layer, with a new one suited to the target task.

# Computer Vision Interview

## Explain convolutional neural networks and apply the concept to three typical use cases.

CNNs are specialized deep learning architectures for processing visual data. Their stack of convolution layers and underlying operations on image data are designed to mimic the visual cortex in animal brains.
CNNs excel at tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

## Describe the role of convolution and pooling layers in CNNs

Convolution layers in CNNs are responsible for feature extraction upon input images. 
Pooling layers downsample feature maps that output by convolutional layers. 

## Challenges in computer vision tasks
Data quantity and quality: Deep learning models for computer vision require very large labeled datasets to be properly trained. These data should also have sufficient quality: high-resolution and noise-free images, free from issues like blur or over-exposure, etc.
Overfitting: CNNs can be prone to memorizing noise or specific (sometimes irrelevant) details in visual training data, leading to poor generalization.
Computational resources: Training deep CNN architectures requires substantial computing resources due to their large number of layers and trainable parameters. Many of them require GPUs and large memory capacities for smooth training.
Interpretability: Understanding how models make predictions (particularly wrong ones) in complex tasks like image recognition remains a challenge.
# NLP Interview Questions
## How do attention mechanisms improve the performance
Transformers have the ability to capture complex patterns, contextual information, and long-range dependencies between elements of an input text, significantly overcoming problems found in previous solutions like limited memory in RNNs
Attention mechanisms essentially weigh the importance of each token in a sequence, without the need to process it token by token.
model pre-training and model fine-tuning
Model pre-training trains a deep learning model, such as BERT, for text classification, on a large corpus of text data (millions to billions of example texts) to learn language representations for general-purpose language understanding.
Model fine-tuning, on the other hand, involves taking a pre-trained model and fine-tuning its learned parameters on a specific downstream NLP application, e.g. sentiment analysis of hotel reviews.

## Architecture of a transformer model like BERT and the types of NLP tasks it can address
The encoder stack consists of multiple encoder layers (see the above diagram). Within each layer, there are (sub)layers of self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks. The key to the language understanding process undertaken by BERT lies in the bidirectional attention flow iteratively applied within the encoder, such that dependencies between words in an input sequence are captured in both directions. Feedforward neural connections “tie together” these learned dependencies into more complex language patterns.
Besides this general characteristic of encoder-only transformers, BERT is characterized by incorporating a Masked Language Modelling (MLM) approach. This mechanism is used during pre-training to mask some words at random, thereby forcing the model to learn to predict masked words based on understanding the context surrounding them.

# Advanced questions
How would you design and implement a deep learning model for a problem with limited labeled data?

Leverage transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained models on a similar domain-specific task to that the original model was trained for.
Explore semi-supervised and self-supervised learning to obtain the most largely unlabeled datasets.
Data augmentation and generative models can help generate synthetic data examples to enrich the original labeled set.
Active learning methodologies can be used to query users to obtain additional labeled samples upon a set of unlabeled data.

## Considerations when deploying deep learning models at scale in real-world production environments

Model scalability and performance
Robustness and reliability
Data privacy and security standards

## How do you envision that recent advances in deep learning could shape the future of the field in terms of applications and wider impact?
Attention mechanisms used in the transformer architectures behind LLMs are revolutionizing the NLP field, significantly pushing the boundaries of NLP tasks and enabling more sophisticated human-machine interactions through conversational AI solutions, question-answering, and much more. The recent inclusion of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in the equation is further helping LLMs in producing truthful and evidence-based language.
Reinforcement learning is one of the most promising AI trends since its principles mimic the basics of how humans learn. Its integration with deep learning architectures, particularly generative models like generative adversarial networks, is at the forefront of scholarly research today. Big names like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, combine these two AI domains in their latest ground-breaking solutions capable of generating “real-like” content in multiple formats.
