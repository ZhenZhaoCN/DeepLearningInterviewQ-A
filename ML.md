## What are the assumptions of linear regression?
Linear regression is used to understand the relation between features (X) and target (y). Before we train the model, we need to meet a few assumptions:

The residuals are independent 
There is a linear relation between X independent variable and y dependent variable. 
Constant residual variance at every level of X
The residuals are normally distributed. 
Note: the residuals in linear regression are the difference between actual and predicted values.
